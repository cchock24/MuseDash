My project is a rhythm game based off of Muse Dash.
It features an interactable UI that allows you to easily transfer between songs and scenes.
Its main feature is its rhythm game. The rhythm game takes advantage of Unityâ€™s Coroutines function to time when to send out notes.
It also streamlines the map making process by including code that creates the map txt files, based on User Input.
